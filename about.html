                <h1>IT'S YAKSHIT</h1>

                <h2>SHORT AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm known as Yakki25x in the gaming world, and my real name is Yakshit Aggarwal. If you come across me while playing, feel free to say hi. 
                    When playing Cricket, I use the name Yakkix25, which is necessary since you have to name your character.
                    Unlike some board games, Cricket lets you save your progress and continue from where you left off later, which makes it more like an MMORPG than a one-time game.
                    I love playing Cricket and wanted to create this website to express my excitement for the game.

                <h2>Motive behind the website?</h2>
                <p>
                    The reason behind my website creation is that I feel the PKIX-style board game category is not yet widely recognized worldwide. 
                    I decided to use this website, along with Cricket, which is highly regarded in this category, to introduce more individuals to the pleasures of this type of game. 
                    One of the significant advantages of Cricket is that it offers an opportunity for 11 people to gather and spend three to four hours enjoying a board game without the worry of repeating the same content repeatedly. 
                    It is a cooperative game that requires a lot of strategic thinking and discussion, and the team either wins or loses together. My goal is to assist others in discovering the fun and excitement of playing Cricket and other PKIX-style board games through this website.
