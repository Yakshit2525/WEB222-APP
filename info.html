                <h2>History of  Cricket</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England. 
                    The first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, and in the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game. There is also the thought that cricket may have derived from bowls,
                    by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away.
                    Village cricket had developed by the middle of the 17th century and the first English “county teams” were formed in the second half of the century, as “local experts” from village cricket were employed as the earliest professionals.
                    The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709.

                <h2>Game rules and objective</h2>
                <p>
                    Cricket is a game played between two teams made up of eleven players each. There is also a reserve player called a “twelfth man” who is used should a player be injured during play.
                    The twelfth man is not allowed to bowl, bat, wicket keep or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a substitute fielder.
                    The original player is free to return to the game as soon as they have recovered from their injury.  
                    To apply the law and make sure the cricket rules are upheld throughout the game there are two umpires in place during games. Umpires are responsible for making decisions and notifying the scorers of these decisions.
                    Two umpires are in place on the playing field while there is also a third umpire off the field who is in charge of video decisions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the start of every scenario, you'll need to choose a character and place it on the board. 
                    The board is an intricate network of hexagons that represent the game world. Here, you'll need to use your character's abilities to fight monsters,
                    overcome obstacles, and solve puzzles. But be warned, the game has rules that dictate how characters move and interact with the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main cricket rules is that for batsmen to score runs they must run to each other’s end of the pitch (from one end to the other). 
                    In doing this one run is scored. Cricket rules state they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A boundary scores the batsmen either 4 or 6 runs.
                    A four is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary after hitting the ground while a six is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary on the full (before it hits the ground). Cricket rules also state that
                    once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically ran by the batsman are null & void. They will only obtain the 4 or 6 runs.
                    Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls, byes & leg byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters.

                <p>
                    But beware, failure is always a possibility. Some scenarios have a "failure" or "defeat" condition that will leave you with nothing to show for your efforts.
                    But don't worry, failure is just another step in the journey. It's an opportunity to learn, adapt, and come back stronger. 
                    After all, the game is designed to challenge you and encourage you to think creatively and strategically.

                    Join the adventure and immerse yourself in the world of Cricket. You won't be disappointed!

                <h2> Tips to learn about Cricket </h2>
                <h3>Tips 1: Begin with "WIDE"</h3>
                <p>
                    A “Wide Ball” will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. 
                    However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide
                    deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman.
                    The batsman is not able to get out off a wide delivery except if they are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field.
                    which can be selected for subsequent campaigns or used to replace characters that have retired.
                </p>

                <p>Here are a few tips for picking starting 11: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consider a balanced team: Try to create a well-rounded team with a good mix of damage-dealers, support characters, and tanks. This will help you handle a variety of situations and challenges in the game.</li>
                    <li>Personal preference: Choose characters that fit your personal playstyle and preferences. Do you prefer to be up close and personal, or do you prefer ranged attacks and support roles? Consider what you enjoy playing and what will keep you engaged in the game.</li>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to experiment: While it's important to have a balanced team, don't be afraid to try out players that may not seem like an obvious fit. Sometimes, unconventional combinations can lead to surprisingly effective strategies.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Note: In total, there are 11 different players available in Cricket, 
                    each with its own unique set of abilities and playstyle. 
                    Players can mix and match these characters in any way they like, allowing for endless combinations and strategies.
                </p>

                <h3>Info 2: NO BALL</h3>
                <P>
                    A “No Ball” can be declared for many reasons: If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), 
                    bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The batsman can hit a no ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a no 
                    ball except if they are ran out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself.
                 </P>

                <p> Here are a few tips to keep in mind when selecting your character's deck in Cricket</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consider your team composition: If you're playing with a group of friends, it's important to consider your team composition and choose a deck that complements the other characters. For example, if your team lacks a Coach, you may want to choose a player with support abilities.</li>
                    <li>Think about your playing 11: Consider how you like to play games and choose a deck that fits your preferred playstyle. If you enjoy playing aggressively, you may want to choose a deck with a lot of offensive abilities. If you prefer to play a more defensive role, you may want to choose a player with more defensive abilities.</li>
                    <li>Don't forget about movement: Movement is an important part of Cricket, so it's important to choose a player that has a good balance of movement abilities. Being able to move quickly and efficiently around the board can be the difference between success and failure.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Info 3: LBW</h3>
                <p>
                    If the ball is bowled and it hits the batsman first without the bat hitting it then an LBW decision is possible.
                    However for the umpire to give this out he must first look at some of the factors stated in the cricket rules.
                    The first thing the umpire need to decide is would the ball have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. 
                    If his answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out.
                    However if the ball hits the batsman outside the line of off stump while he was attempting to play a stroke then he is not out.   
                </p>
